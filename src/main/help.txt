# What to do?

Early commands:

    run simple.js n00dles all
    run tools/prep-auto.js --ignore harakiri-sushi,n00dles --host small --tail
    
    run sample/diamond-hands.js
    run sample/stalefish-batcher.js alpha-ent peta-1 --tail


## Starting a new BitNode

After the first, you will start with +16% multipliers and 32gb ram, so that is nice.
The first thing to do is increase hacking skill and get a little cash.  This command
will map out the servers, root what you can, and show stats on all the servers.

> run tools/scan.js

You start with these servers with ram available:

* 4gb
  * n00dles
* 16gb
  * foodnstuff 
  * sigma-cosmetics
  * joesguns
  * nectar-net
  * hong-fang-tea
  * harakiri-sushi
  
So run a command to start hacking n00dles automatically with all available servers:

    run simple.js n00dles all

* After 2m15 the grows finish and I'm level 11
* After 37s, the hacks finish and I'm level 15
* After 35s, another hack round finishes and I'm level 18 and have $324k

Now go to 'Alpha-Ent' on the city map and buy a TOR Router for $200k

Soon we should have $500k and can buy BruteSSH.exe to root some more servers:

* 8gb
  * CSEC
* 32gb
  * neo-net
  * zer0
  * max-hardware
  * iron-gym

Look out for other money milestones to open more ports and get more free ram for our scripts:

* $1.5m - FTPCrack.exe
* $5m - relaySMTP.exe
* $30m - HTTPWorm.exe
* $250m - SQLInject.exe

After getting FTPCrack.exe and relaySMTP.exe we have some more servers:

32gb - phantasy
64gb - silver-helix
32gb - omega-net
64gb - avmnite-02h (backdoor)
8gb - the-hub
64gb - I.I.I.I (backdoor)
32gb - netlink
16gb - rothman-uni
128gb - catalyst
32gb - summit-uni
64gb - rho-construction
128gb - millenium-fitness

Let's get those to work on harakiri-sushi also

    run simple.js harakiri-sushi phantasy,silver-helix,omega-net,avmnite-02h,the-hub,I.I.I.I,netlink,rothman-uni,catalyst,summit-uni,rho-construction,millenium-fitness

Great, let's get those working on foodnstuff:

    run simple.js foodnstuff CSEC,neo-net,zer0,max-hardware,iron-gym

Actually, foodnstuff sucks for growth, once you hit hacking level 40 (or before
because it takes a while to weaken/grow), run it on harakiri-sushi after killing
those on the servers:

    run simple.js harakiri-sushi CSEC,neo-net,zer0,max-hardware,iron-gym

* The weakens will take 4:15 the first round

Now I have $3.5m, enough to buy a 64gb server

    run tools/servers.js buy small 64

And I'll run a script to automatically work on prepping servers, ignoring the ones we're hacking:

    run tools/prep-auto.js --ignore harakiri-sushi,n00dles --host small --tail

That'll get us some xp and prepare the servers for future hacking.

Actually going to the city and slums and doing 'rob a store', 36% success, about 100 seconds,
and would make $464k plus some good hacking/dex/agi xp





This will be running weaken, grow, and hack against n00dles.  n00dles doesn't have a lot of money,
but it has 3000 growth so you don't spend as much time growing it.

One of the first things to do should be to raise hacking skill.  
This can be slow when you start a new bitnode, especially one where the modifiers
are low.  The home server starts with 4gb I think, not even enough to run some of the
scripts I use ALL the time

* `tools/scan.js` - 5.4gb
* `simple.js` - 7.4gb

Some help can be had running things on these servers:

* 16gb - (1 hacking) foodnstuff
* 4gb  - (1 hacking) n00dles
* 16gb - (5 hacking) sigma-cosmetics

Until getting at least 8gb of ram (costs $???.?k), you can manually copy /remote/simple.js
to foodnstuff, connect to foodnstuff, and run it there with 7 threads, targeting the same
server.  You can help by running manual `weaken` and `grow` commands to get it started.

  scp remote/simple.js foodnstuff
  connect foodnstuff
  run remote/simple.js foodnstuff 4 4.5e10 7 -t 7 --tail

The args are target difficulty (4 when min is 3), target money ($45m max is $50m)
and number of threads to use for hacking, which might be good to lower, and '--tail'
which opens the log so you can see what is happening.  You will probably have to wait quite
a bit for it to maximize the server's money and then it will start hacking and making you money.
It will be gaining you xp along the way, so you can copy the script to sigma-cosmetics
and run it there when you hti level 5.

## End-grme scripts

* run sample/stalefish-batcher.js ecorp home --tail




Ok, at level 222 I bought two 4tb servers ('tera' and 'tera-0'), time to rock it!

Prepping omega-net with one:

    run tools/prep.js omega-net --host tera

And grinding xp with the other:

    run start-grind.js tera-0

Bought a 16tb server 'tera-1' and finally time to start batching!  Got 848m at 12:35

Should have some serious xp grinding servers soon...

Ok, finally fixed my nagging issue - solveForWeakens() didn't take into account that hack
percent could be over 100%, now it limits it to 90% or decreases hack threads.
